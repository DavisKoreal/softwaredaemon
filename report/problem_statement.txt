2. Problem Statement\nSmallholder farmers, producing 70% of global food, face barriers in managing crop health. Limited access to experts (1:1093 extension officer ratio in Kenya vs. 1:400 recommended, The Guardian), misdiagnoses, and ineffective treatments cause 20â€“40% annual crop losses (20B globally, FAO). For example, Kenyan maize farmers lose 40% of yields to fall armyworm due to delayed interventions (CABI.org). AgriGuide tackles these challenges with AI-driven diagnostics and localized supplier connections.
