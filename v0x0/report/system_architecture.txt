6. System Architecture\nAgriGuide’s architecture ensures modularity and scalability:  \nFrontend: Next.js with React hooks (useGeolocation.ts, useHashState.ts) for dynamic UI.  \n\nBackend: Next.js API routes (app/api/geolocation/route.ts) and server actions (lib/actions.ts).  \n\nAI Service: OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini for pest/disease analysis (scanPestImage).  \n\nDatabase: Prisma for structured data (users, scans, products); Supabase for image storage.  \n\nGeolocation: ipgeolocation.io and bigdatacloud.net APIs for supplier mapping.  \n\nAuthentication: NextAuth.js with Prisma adapter (auth.ts).  \n\nDiagram: A flowchart (to be inserted) illustrates component interactions.\nReal-World Example: PlantVillage uses a similar client-server model (WIRED).
