1. Executive Summary
The Farmer AI Assistant App, branded as AgriGuide, is a web-based platform empowering smallholder farmers in Africa to manage crop health. Using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for image-based pest and disease diagnostics, it delivers instant diagnoses, tailored recommendations, and connections to local agri-input suppliers via geolocation APIs. Built with Next.js, Prisma, Supabase, and TypeScript, AgriGuide ensures scalability, security, and accessibility. The system supports farmers, suppliers, consultants, and admins through role-based access, as seen in auth.ts. Drawing inspiration from PlantVillage Nuru and Kuzi, AgriGuide addresses crop losses and promotes sustainable farming practices.
