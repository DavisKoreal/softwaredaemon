8. System Workflows\nKey workflows, coded in lib/actions.ts, include:  \nDiagnosis: Image upload → OpenAI analysis (scanPestImage) → Store in Supabase/Prisma → Display results.  \n\nSupplier Connection: Geolocation fetch (useClientGeolocation) → API call (app/api/geolocation/route.ts) → Supplier list rendering.  \n\nProduct Management: Supplier submits product (addProduct) → Validates with addProductFormSchema → Stores in Prisma/Supabase.  \n\nProgress Tracking: Compare images (trackProgress) → AI analysis → Return progress report.\nReal-World Example: AgriApp’s diagnosis pipeline is similar (AgriApp.com).
